      <p><em> "Pompei, the bustling city on the Gulf of Naples, passed away in a dramatic volcanic catastrophe rarely
          experienced by mankind. For the scientists of modern times, however, the tragedy was a stroke of luck, because

          <h3 id="top">The Rise of Pompeii </h3>
          <p>Pompeii was founded by the Greeks in the 6th century BC. A small rise on an old lava flow of Vesuvius
            offered a good view over the terrain and thus protection from hostile Etruscans. At the mouth of the river
            Sarno a small harbour was built where goods from the surrounding area were shipped. Wine and olive trees
            grew on the fertile slopes of the volcano, further inland cereals were cultivated. Thus Pompeii developed
            into a prosperous trading city within a few centuries. In 290 BC the city was occupied by the Romans. Since
            that time, rich citizens have fled every summer from the sultry confines of Rome to Pompeii. The fortified
            city grew. Three thermal baths were built and lead water pipes were laid. Pompeii had a theatre, an odeon
            and an arena. Besides trade, art and culture flourished. The Romans also encouraged carnal lust: 13 public
            brothels were discovered during the excavations. Grain was ground in biconical mills made of lava rock and
            baked into bread in the 31 bakeries. In the cookshops - the Thermopolien - the citizens ate a quick meal
            standing up. In 62 AD, large parts of Pompeii were destroyed by an earthquake. The money from Rome flowed
            sparsely and so the reconstruction dragged on for years. When in 79 A.D. the final out of the city was
            sealed by Vesuvius, not all the damage of the quake had been repaired when the final end of the city was
            sealed.
          </p>

          <h3>The Fall Of The Cursed Ones</h3>
          <p>It was a mild summer morning on that Oktober 24, 79, when the ground in Pompeii was once again shaking. The
            thunder of a violent explosion abruptly tore the citizens from their daily lives. Frightened, they looked
            towards Vesuvius, from which the terrible noise emanated, and they saw that the mountain had blown away its
            summit. In its place a crater had appeared, from which columns of fire were beating. A grey, pine-shaped
            cloud of dust and rock debris darkened the sky within minutes and turned day into night. The distraught
            people feared the wrath of the gods. Torches were lit, prayers were said, but it was no use: half an hour
            later volcanic ash, dust, lapilli and foamy pieces of pumice poured down on Pompeii.

            At the summit of Vesuvius, ten kilometers away, an inferno raged. Under high pressure, the volcano
            tirelessly spewed fragmented lava. Glowing lumps and debris of old rock rumbled down to the valley and
            burned the vegetation on the volcanic slope. The eruption cloud had meanwhile reached the stratosphere. The
            city had the misfortune that the wind blew from the direction of Vesuvius and drove the cloud towards it.
            Rocks were hailing from the cloud. The deposits in Pompeii grew upwards at a speed of 20 centimeters per
            hour. People panicked, many gathered their belongings and tried to flee. Others sought shelter in their
            homes. But the open construction of the atrium houses offered insufficient protection. Toxic gases
            penetrated the rooms, the roofs groaned under their stone load. Already in the afternoon, many a roof
            structure gave way and collapsed.

            The first phase of the eruption lasted twelve hours. Around midnight, the bombardment from volcanic products
            subsided. The inhabitants of Pompeii believed they had survived the worst, but the respite was short.

            As the pressure from the crater decreased, the rising eruption cloud collapsed, generating pyroclastic
            flows. The first glowing clouds did not reach Pompeii, however, but destroyed the neighbouring city of
            Herculaneum. Herculaneum was much closer to Vesuvius than Pompeii, but until then it had been largely spared
            from the eruption. In the pyroclastic flows the people died an agonizing death. Even those who had found
            shelter in a house burned to death in the 800 degree hot gases on which a stream of ashes and rocks moved,
            crushing everything that the gases had not destroyed.

            In the early morning hours of 25 August, four pyroclastic flows reached Pompeii, killing everyone who was
            still alive in the city. Pompeii was now completely buried under tephra. In the course of the day two more
            pyroclastic flows occurred, which finally covered the former city area. Pompeii was now buried under a
            shroud twelve metres thick. In Herculaneum, which was only six kilometers away from the crater, the volcanic
            deposits piled up to a height of 20 meters. The sunken cities were forgotten. If there had been the
            technical possibilities then as there are today, the sinking of Pompeii and Herculaneum could probably not
            have been prevented, but the cities would have been evacuated and the events would have been precisely
            documented. Thus, apart from the ruins, there are only a few eyewitness accounts of the natural catastrophe
            that have been handed down in writing.
          </p>

          <h3>Ashes to Remnants, Dust to Fear.. </h3>
          <p>Pompeii SacrificesThe sunken cities were legends from a long time ago, when towards the end of the 16th
            century some pieces of marble and coins were accidentally found on their territory. Little by little, the
            ancient treasures were looted. It was looted and stolen. Many treasures fell into the hands of dubious
            collectors during this time. It was not until the 18th century that systematic excavations began - the birth
            of modern archaeology. To date, a good four fifths of the old city area has been uncovered. More than 2000
            corpses have been found, mostly as cavities in the lava rock, which were filled with plaster. However, the
            scientists assume a total of more than 16,000 victims. This estimate also includes the perished inhabitants
            of the surrounding area. The population of Pompeii at the time of the disaster was about 20,000.

            The eruption in 79 was not the first major catastrophe to emanate from Vesuvius. A good 1800 years earlier
            the volcano had already buried the huts of a Bronze Age settlement under ashes. Away from these huts,
            archaeologists found the skeletons of two people whose footprints had been preserved in the ashes. It was
            probably a pair of farmers who had been fleeing the eruptions. The settlement was located near the
            present-day village of Avellino, northeast of the volcano and much further away from it than Pompeii. At a
            distance of 35 kilometres, the layer of ash deposits was still 50 centimetres thick. Scientists discovered
            traces of repopulation after the eruption, but apparently this attempt was unsuccessful due to environmental
            destruction. According to volcanologists, such a catastrophe could repeat itself in the near future.
            However, unlike in the past, the population of the Naples conurbation is now not just a few thousand people,
            but millions. In the event of an eruption such as that which occurred in 79 AD, 800,000 people would now be
            directly affected. A successful evacuation depends on the length of the early warning period. Vesuvius is
            one of the best observed volcanoes on Earth, and the observatory on this mountain, established in 1841, was
            the first of its kind. Italy can therefore be considered the cradle of volcanology and modern archaeology at
            the same time.

            A lot has happened since the first observatory with its mechanical measuring instruments was built. Today
            Vesuvius is monitored with the most modern computer technology. Even a virtual walk through the resurrected
            Pompeii is possible.</p>
