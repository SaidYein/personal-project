      It’s all about drawing out your best qualities and using them to create opportunities. It’s also about using your unconditional love to help the people you care about."</em></p>

       <p> We live in a world where society has pretty much conditioned each and every one of us to act and behave the same way as everyone else. Being different and unique than others is either scoffed at or frowned upon. <br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span> Whenever you try to break away from the status quo, you are either labeled as a misfit or an outcast.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>Whatever happened to being a unique individual? Of doing what you want to do with your life without being judged and ridiculed for being different than others? Society has pretty much killed the true essence of the word 'individuality' that they might as well scratch that word out from the dictionary.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>Because of this...<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>A lot of people have their dreams crushed without even starting because people say they won't make it as it's a path less taken.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>A lot of voices and ideas are never expressed for fear of being rejected and made fun of by their peers.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>A lot of people are 'forced' to do things they don't like just so they can 'fit' in with the group.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>A lot of people are not actually living their own identity just to please others.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>Well, I say enough of this!<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>They don't own our life! We're not robots that they can just program to behave like others! We're not living in a dictatorship country! And we certainly don't owe them anything!<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>It's OKAY to not have good grades and excel in class just like the rest of your classmates.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>It's OKAY to have different hobbies and interests than your friends because everyone has their own thing.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>It's OKAY to not work on a boring 9 to 5 job and instead, you work for yourself because you want to be your own boss.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>It's OKAY to not be married at 27 years old like the rest of your buddies because they say it's the 'right' age to do so<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>It's OKAY to speak your mind and express your opinion that others might find weird and funny.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>It's OKAY to be yourself.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>Life is too short to be living our lives the way others want us to live it. We certainly don't need anyone's 'permission' to do what we want. We only get to live in this world once so might as well make the best of it. So at the end of the day, don't be afraid to be yourself, seize the day and you do you.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>Do you have anything to share about an experience in your life where you didn't just 'follow the herd' but you did something different instead?<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>I would love to hear from you. Please leave a comment below.<br><br><span style="padding-left: 64px;"></span>If you find this piece useful, don't forget to upvote and resteem.</p> <p style="float: right;"><a href="#top">Sayfa Başına git</a>
